# Saber Scraper
Web Scraper for baseball data

This projected started as a scraper for baseball data, I'm going to turn it into a general-purpose
dashboard for NFL, CFB, and MLB Data

The idea is to compile data from a variety of sources (Twitter, Vegas, Sabermetrics), combine it, and
try to use it to make meaning predicitons. May sprinkle in some Machine Learning while we're at it.

I will keep this ReadMe updated as the project progresses
